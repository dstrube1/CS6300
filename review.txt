Assignments 1-5 & the IndividualProject were easy &/or fun. (I enjoyed the Group Project, but it depends on largely who you're assigned to.) Assignment 6 really illustrated what was missing from the lectures and any other teaching material - path coverage. Statement coverage is straightforward; branch coverage is a little more nuanced, but understandable. But for path coverage: the information about it from the lectures is nearly worthless. You're basically going to have to teach yourself about it. Good luck.
